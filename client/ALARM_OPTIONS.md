# Alarm Popup Options for Codifier Extension

I've created two modern alternatives to replace the old-fashioned `reminder.html` popup:

## Option 1: Modern System Notifications (Recommended)
**File:** `background.js` (already updated)

**Features:**
- Uses Chrome's native notification API
- Clean, modern system notifications
- Interactive buttons (Open Contest, Dismiss)
- Works even when browser is minimized
- No separate window needed
- Better user experience

**How it works:**
- When alarm triggers, shows a system notification
- Click notification or "Open Contest" button to open contest URL
- Click "Dismiss" to close notification
- Fallback to badge if notifications fail

## Option 2: Modern Custom Popup Window
**Files:** 
- `background-modern-popup.js` (alternative background script)
- `modern-reminder.html` (beautiful modern popup)
- `modern-reminder.js` (popup functionality)

**Features:**
- Beautiful glassmorphism design
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Platform-specific icons
- Countdown timer
- Responsive design
- Keyboard shortcuts (ESC to close)
- Auto-close after 15 seconds

**How to use this option:**
1. Rename `background-modern-popup.js` to `background.js`
2. The modern popup will automatically be used

## Current Setup
- **Active:** Option 1 (System Notifications)
- **Fallback:** Badge on extension icon
- **Files:** All modern files are included and ready to use

## Benefits of the New System
✅ **Modern UI/UX** - No more old-fashioned popup windows  
✅ **Better Integration** - Uses native browser features  
✅ **Reliable** - Multiple fallback options  
✅ **User-Friendly** - Clear actions and feedback  
✅ **Responsive** - Works on all screen sizes  

## Testing
To test the alarm feature:
1. Set a contest reminder for 1 minute from now
2. Wait for the alarm to trigger
3. You'll see the modern notification/popup
4. Click "Open Contest" to test URL opening

The old `reminder.html` is still available as a backup, but the new system provides a much better user experience!
